# game_feed

Welcome to Game Feed 
The new website where gamers can talk about and review their favorite games
they can also upload the games they have created themselves and get feedback from the community.

Future goals

The end goal of the product is to have the ability to create your own account(or a business account)
and upload your games for feedback from others. Hopefully the website will be used by big game devs 
for inspiration for their future development towards their games. Based on the communities wants and
needs.
